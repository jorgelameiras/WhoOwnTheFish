### Description

The puzzle is attributed to Albert Einstein and can be solved using logical deduction

* There are five houses in a row and in five different colors.

* In each house lives a person from a different country.

* Each person drinks a certain drink, plays a certain sport, and keeps a certain pet.

* No two people drink the same drink, play the same sport, or keep the same pet.


## You start with these hints:

* The Brit lives in a red house
* The Swede keeps dogs
* The Dane drinks tea
* The green house is on the left of the white house
* The green house owner drinks coffee
* The person who plays polo rears birds
* The owner of the yellow house plays hockey
* The man living in the house right in the center drinks milk
* The Norwegian lives in the first house
* The man who plays baseball lives next to the man who keeps cats
* The man who keeps horses lives next to the one who plays hockey
* The man who plays billiards drinks beer
* The German plays soccer
* The Norwegian lives next to the blue house
* The man who plays baseball has a neighbor who drinks water.

## Coding Solution

I used the backtracking algorithm to find the solution for this puzzle. 


// Explain the code better here after I take a look and make some tweaks to it to print the name of the person who owns the fish.
